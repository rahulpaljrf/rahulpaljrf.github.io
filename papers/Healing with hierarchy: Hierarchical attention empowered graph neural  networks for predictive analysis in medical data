Key contributions of the proposed Work: 1. Hierarchical attention: In HAIL, we introduce a novel hierarchical attention-based integrated learning mechanism. that employs
hierarchical attention at two levels: first, at the sentence level for context-aware embedding extraction, and second, at the feature level for addressing missing values. The innovation of 
this approach lies in its capacity to utilize hierarchical attention for context-aware embedding extraction while learning from a patient’s attributes (local features) to fill in missing 
values. 2. Learning from cohorts: To enhance information acquisition, we present a weighted patient graph that leverages the features of patients derived from their associated cohort 
(global features) to enrich the patient embeddings.
